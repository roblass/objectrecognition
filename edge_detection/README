General
^^^^^^^
This archive contains two python scripts.  edge_roberts.py was written first,
and it performs edge detection based on the Roberts algorithm.  RobMask.py was
written next, based on edge_roberts.py.  It performs edge detection using any
3x3 mask you give it.

The output images are saved in a directory called "output_images".

Environment
^^^^^^^^^^^
This was developed and tested on my Macintosh G4 Powerbook running OSX Version
10.4.0 and Python version 2.3.

Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^
This program requires python2, the python imaging library (PIL), and has been
tested with versions 10.1.4 and 10.1.3.  For RobMask.py, you will also need a
file with coefficients in it to apply to the image.  sobel.coe and prewitt.coe
are given as examples.

Example Invocations
^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^
python edge_roberts.py rob_vs_bull.jpg
python RobMask.py sobel.coe rob_vs_bull.jpg
python RobMask.py prewitt.coe rob_vs_bull.jpg

For an idea of what the output looks like, I have included rob_vs_bull.png,
which was used as input to the roberts edge detector and
rob_vs_bull_example_output.png, which is an image showing the lines detected
by the program.
