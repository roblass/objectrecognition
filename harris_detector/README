General
^^^^^^^
This archive contains my implementation of the harris corner detection
algorithm.  The resulting images are saved in the "output_images" directory.

Environment
^^^^^^^^^^^
This was developed and tested on my Macintosh G4 Powerbook running OSX Version
10.4.1, and MacPython version 2.4.

Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^
This program requires the python imaging library (tested with PIL 10.1.3 and
10.1.4), and python 2.4.

Examples
^^^^^^^^ 
python corner_harris rob_vs_bull.png

I've included a file rob_vs_bull.png, used as input, and
rob_vs_bull_example_output.png, which is the output produced by the harris
corner detector.  You can see, among other things, how diagonal lines cause
problems with this algorithm.

Files
^^^^^
README - this file
RobMask.py - reads a mask from a file, and performs convolution
corner_harris.py - program implementing the harris corner detector
gpl.txt - the license this program is released under
prewitt.coe - coefficients for my edge detector

Licensing
^^^^^^^^^
I release all of this code under version 2 of the GPL.  A copy of this license
can be found in gpl.txt.
